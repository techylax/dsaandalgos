/**
 * Approach: Add Two Integer LinkedList in Reverse Order
 * Just like how you would sum two numbers on a piece of paper,
 * we begin by summing the least-significant digits, which is the head of l1 and l2.
 * Since each digit is in the range of 0…9, summing two digits may "overflow".
 * For example 5 + 7 = 12.
 * In this case, we set the current digit to 2 and bring over the carry = 1 to the next iteration.
 * carry must be either 0 or 1 because the largest possible sum of two digits (including the carry) is 9 + 1 = 19.
 *
 * The pseudocode is as following:
 *  1. Initialize current node to dummy head of the returning list.
 *  2. Initialize carry to 0.
 *  3. Initialize p1 and p2 to head of l1 and l2 respectively.
 *  4. Loop through lists l1 and l2 until you reach both ends.
 *  5. Set x to node p1's value. If p1 has reached the end of l1, set to 0.
 *  6. Set y to node p2's value. If p2 has reached the end of l2, set to 0.
 *  7. Set sum = x + y + carry.
 *  8. Update carry = sum / 10.
 *  9. Create a new node with the digit value of (sum mod 10) and set it to current node's next, then advance current node to next.
 *  10. Advance both p1 and p2.
 *  11. Check if carry = 1, if so append a new node with digit 11 to the returning list.
 *  12. Return dummy head's next node.
 *
 * Note that we use a dummy head to simplify the code.
 * Without a dummy head, you would have to write extra conditional statements to initialize the head's value.
 * Take extra caution of the following cases:
 *  Test case	Explanation
 *  l1=[0,1]
 *  l2=[0,1,2]	When one list is longer than the other.
 *  l1=[]
 *  l2=[0,1]	When one list is null, which means an empty list.
 *  l1=[9,9]
 *  l2=[1]	    The sum could have an extra carry of one at the end, which is easy to forget.
 *
 * Complexity Analysis
 *  Time complexity : O(max(m,n)).
 *  Assume that m and n represents the length of l1 and l2 respectively,
 *  the algorithm above iterates at most max(m,n) times.
 *  Space complexity : O(1).
 *
 * Follow up
 * What if the the digits in the linked list are stored in non-reversed order? For example:
 * (3→4→2)+(4→6→5)=8→0→7
